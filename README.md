# Comparative ML Tree Classification

A comparative analysis of machine learning models for tree species classification using various methodologies.

## Project Structure

### Input_Experimentation
#### Indices
Exploring different input combinations:Only indices, Only spectral bands etc

#### Patch_Size
Experiments varying input patch size.

#### Time
Experiments varying temporal window.


### Handling_Class_Imbalance
Methods to address class imbalance:
- Class weighting  
- Hierarchical labeling  
- SMOTE oversampling(as model1 in benchmarking models)

### Benchmarking_Models
Implementations of different ML models.

**Includes:**
- Performance results and comparisons

### GEE_Codes
Google Earth Engine scripts for:
- Data extraction  
- Preprocessing
